# UI Test Automation

In our test automation framework, we leveraged Cucumber, Selenium, and TestNG to conduct UI Testing for web applications. We implemented the Page Object Model (POM) for better test structure, improving maintainability and reusability. Using Gherkin syntax, we defined user-friendly scenarios for behavior-driven testing, ensuring seamless test execution across different browsers. Our automated tests covered functional flows, form validations, UI responsiveness, and user interactions, verifying that the front-end behaved as expected across various use cases. TestNG was used for parallel execution and reporting, ensuring efficient test execution and result tracking.
